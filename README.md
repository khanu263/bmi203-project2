This repository contains a Python implementation of **breadth-first search (BFS)**, a graph traversal algorithm that visits all nodes at a given depth before proceeding to the next level, beginning with a specified start node. If no end node is specified, the algorithm will return the path of traversal through the full graph. If an end node is specified, the algorithm will return the shortest path between the start node and the end node, if one exists.
